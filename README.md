# Email-Spam-or-Harm-Detection-using Multiple Machine Learning Models
This project aims to develop machine learning models to classify emails as either spam or harmful using Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes algorithms. The models can be deployed in email filtering systems to automatically identify and quarantine suspicious messages, thereby enhancing email security and user experience.

# Overview

Machine learning techniques offer a more robust and adaptive approach to email filtering by leveraging statistical patterns and textual features to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails. In this project, we employ Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and Naive Bayes algorithms to develop effective spam detection models.

# Key Features
Data Collection

Data Preprocessing

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and Naive Bayes models on the training data and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Assess the trained models' performance on the validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
